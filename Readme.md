## Synopsis

This goal of this project is to predict which country the new user would book for the first time. The destination country we have are Australia, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Great Britain, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, the U.S. and others.


## Motivation

Airbnb is nowadays becoming more and more popular around the world for travellers and hosts. Since its new way of hosting and booking, Airbnb changes the traditional host from hotel only to the common resident houses.People who travel a lot could easily book a place to live for one or two nights, or even for months. Airbnb collects peoples travel data from the whole world to do the analysis. Because of this, we decide to do some research about Airbnb data and use some different algorithms to make the predictions. Fortunately, airbnb hosts a competition in Kaggle,and we plan to participate this competition as term project.
